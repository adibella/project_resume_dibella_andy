##Resources Used
* [**jQuery .hover()**](https://api.jquery.com/hover/) : This gave me a pretty good framework on how to use the jQuery hover effect. The coding examples served as a base for the custom jQuery code I used in my project.
* All other resources I used was lectures and links conbined with the feedback you gave on previous homework assignments.

##Custom jQuery and Plug-In Explanations

* **Custom jQuery:** This appears first in my javascript file. The jQuery creates a hover effect over my name at the top of the resume. If you hover over "Andy DiBella", it will change color.
* **[FitText](http://fittextjs.com/)** I applied this plug-in to my headings. I kept it really subtle so there isn't much of an obvious change in the sizing of the headings. As far as I can tell it works well.
* **[FlowText](http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/)** This plug-in was applied to all the text on the page. Again, I tried to keep this as subtle as possible. It deals primarily with taking a responsive approach to keeping a certain number of characters per line. Few lines in my resume are effected, but if you look at the larger bodies of text you can see that it's present.

##Comments
A lot of things I had been struggling with really came together on this assignment. As far as I can see I was able to meet all the requirements. I think the visual stylization could be a bit better.

Thanks for your feedback and efforts!
